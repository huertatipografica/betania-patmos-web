**WEG* font is an experimental type system where legibility isn’t the focus.

This project studies how glyphs are constructed and how their ductus can be modified.
I explored how far I can move the limits if I don’t worry about the legibility.
In Weg, letters are built by a single line that connects them, along with words and paragraphs. When weight decreases, the legibility of the signs increases.
This is the first stage. It’s a project in expansion.

The set contains uppercase, lining figures and basic punctuation in three weights: Regular, Light and Thin. The current supported languages are Spanish, Guaraní and English. If you need any other language, please let me know. I would like to expand the character set.
